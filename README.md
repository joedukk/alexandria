The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world.

## What is this?

Alexandria is a coding sandbox written in React. I primarily use this for testing new components, developing proof of concepts and doing general experimenting in. Most code here is likely bugged and or not optimized, proceed with caution!

## Features

- styled-components
- prettier / husky integration
